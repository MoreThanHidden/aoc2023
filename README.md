- Day 1 - Part 1:

  Interesting Challange to find the first and last digits.
- Day 1 - Part 2:
  
  A lot more difficult as some words use the same space and couldn't replace them i.e twone is 21 

- Day 2 - Part 1:

  Straight forward Carriage Return caused some issues, red, green and blue max.
- Day 2 - Part 2:

  Using the Max Function to find the max for each colour then multiply them and add to the total.
- Day 3 - Part 1:

  Started this very awkwardly, but got there in the end.

  This was a lot more difficult ended up storing the coordinates in a range and then checking if the symbol was contained.
